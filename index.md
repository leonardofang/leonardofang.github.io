#### Hello, I am Le Fang, an M.Phil. graduate in Computer Science from [The University of Hong Kong (HKU)](https://www.hku.hk/), supervised by [Prof. Chuan Wu](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~cwu/index.html). Before that, I obtained M.Eng. in Information Engineering from [Zhejiang University (ZJU)](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), supervised by [Prof. Kejie Huang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/huangkejie). Now I am searching for Ph.D. opportunities in  AI, ML, Data Mining, IoT for Healthcare and other related fields around the WORLD! I would be gratefully passionate to collaborate with researchers in diverse advancing computer technologies. Please kindly refer to my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pHbk76sNqXM0_bdypNRC_9PlODuZrtaM/view?usp=sharing) or contact me through e-mail (lefang@connect.hku.hk).

## My current research TOPICS span as follows:
#### - AI, Data Science for Healthcare
#### - IoT for Smart Home

## My Projects:
#### - Emotional Gesture Sensing (Ongoing :fire:)
##### Stress is an universally ubiquitous emotional state and takes place everywhere. In our research, we present an empirical study on stress detection based on   gestures and proposes a stress detection system by linking the gesture frequency with diverse stress levels.
#### - Elderly Gait-Balance Monitoring System
#### - Exercise Video Recommendation for Parkinson's Disease (PD) Patients
#### - A Nonintrusive Elderly Home Monitoring System
#### - Raw Food Recognition and Nutrition Analysis
