#### Hello, I am Le (Leo) Fang, a 2021 M.Phil. graduate in Computer Science from [The University of Hong Kong (HKU)](https://www.hku.hk/), under the supervision of [Prof. Chuan Wu](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~cwu/index.html). Prior to that, I received my M.Eng. in Information Engineering from [Zhejiang University (ZJU)](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) in 2019, supervised by [Prof. Kejie Huang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/huangkejie). My research interests include Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Data Mining, and IoT for Healthcare, among other related fields. I am eager to collaborate with researchers who are passionate about advancing computer technologies for practical applications.

## My current research TOPICS span as follows:
#### - AI, Data Science for Healthcare
#### - IoT for Smart Home


## My Projects:
#### - Emotional Gesture Sensing (Ongoing :fire:)
##### Stress is an universally ubiquitous emotional state and takes place everywhere. In our research, we present an empirical study on stress detection based on   gestures and proposes a stress detection system by linking the gesture frequency with diverse stress levels.
#### - Elderly Gait-Balance Monitoring System
#### - Exercise Video Recommendation for Parkinson's Disease (PD) Patients
##### “PDex” is an exercise recommendation app designed for Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients, which focuses on exercise recovery research for PD patients. Now we provide both iOS and Android versions. Detailed are included in the [Test Guideline](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bH4FAOvC6DQZ_qSEte93dAJAth4aztxp0S3UrtxEbtA/edit). 
#### - A Nonintrusive Elderly Home Monitoring System
#### - Raw Food Recognition and Nutrition Analysis
